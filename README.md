## Task-Tracker
A project used to track and manage tasks. A simple command line interface (CLI) program built with Go and Cobra

### Requirements
The application should run from the command line, accept user actions and inputs as arguments and store the tasks in a JSON file. The user should be able to :
- Add, Update and Delete tasks
- Mark a task as in progress or done
- List all tasks
- List all tasks that are done
- List all tasks that are not done
- List all tasks that are in progress

### Example
The list of commands and their usage is given below
```sh
# Adding a new task
task-cli add "Buy groceries"
# Output: Task added successfully (ID: 1)

# Updating and deleting tasks
task-cli update 1 "Buy groceries and cook dinner"
task-cli delete 1

# Marking a task as in progress or done
task-cli mark-in-progress 1
task-cli mark-done 1

# Listing all tasks
task-cli list

# Listing tasks by status
task-cli list done
task-cli list todo
task-cli list in-progress
```

### Task Properties
Each task should have the following properties:

- id: A unique identifier for the task
- description: A short description of the task
- status: The status of the task (todo, in-progress, done)
- createdAt: The date and time when the task was created
- updatedAt: The date and time when the task was last updated
- Make sure to add these properties to the JSON file when adding a new task and update them when updating a task.
